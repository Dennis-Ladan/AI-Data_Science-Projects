This repository contains a curated selection of computer vision projects that were integral to my experience and skill development at World Quant University. These projects were completed as part of their structured learning programs and demonstrate my proficiency in a range of computer vision techniques, from fundamental image analysis to potentially more sophisticated applications, all achieved within the academic framework provided by the university.
